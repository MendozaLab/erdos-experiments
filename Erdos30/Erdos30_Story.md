## 1. The game

Here is a game anyone can play. Pick some numbers between 0 and 100. Now take every possible pair of your numbers --- including pairing a number with itself --- and add them together. Write down all the sums. Your one rule: **no two different pairs can produce the same sum.**

Start small. Pick {0, 1, 3}. The pairwise sums are:

    0+0 = 0    0+1 = 1    0+3 = 3
    1+1 = 2    1+3 = 4    3+3 = 6

Six sums, all different. You win. This kind of set is called a **Sidon set**, after the Hungarian mathematician Simon Sidon who first asked Erdos about them in 1932.

Now try to add a fourth number. Can you add 5? Check: we already have sums 0,1,2,3,4,6. Adding 5 gives new sums 0+5=5, 1+5=6 --- stop. We already have 6 from 3+3. Collision. So 5 doesn't work.

Try 7 instead: 0+7=7, 1+7=8, 3+7=10, 7+7=14. All new. So {0, 1, 3, 7} is a Sidon set with four elements. You can keep going: {0, 1, 3, 7, 12, 20} works with six elements in {0,...,24}.

But as N grows, you start to feel the walls closing in. Every new number you add creates new sums that might collide with old ones. The more numbers you have, the more crowded the sum-space becomes. Eventually, collisions are unavoidable.

The question is: **exactly when?**

## 2. The pigeonhole squeeze

There's an elegant argument that any 12th grader can follow. If you pick k numbers from {0, 1, ..., N}, how many pairwise sums can you form? Count the ordered pairs (a, b) with a <= b. There are k choices for a, and for each a, the values b >= a give roughly k/2 choices. The exact count is k(k+1)/2.

Where do these sums land? The smallest possible sum is 0+0=0. The largest is N+N=2N. So all k(k+1)/2 sums must fit inside {0, 1, ..., 2N}, which has 2N+1 slots.

If the sums are all distinct (the Sidon condition), then:

    k(k+1)/2  <=  2N + 1

Rearrange: k is roughly at most sqrt(4N), which simplifies to about sqrt(2N) ~ 1.41 * sqrt(N).

This is the **Erdos-Turan bound** from 1941. It's the kind of argument Feynman loved: no tricks, no machinery, just counting two things and noticing one must be at least as big as the other. The pigeonhole principle in action.

## 3. The mysterious gap

Here's where it gets interesting. The pigeonhole argument says k <= ~1.41 * sqrt(N). But the best Sidon sets anyone can actually *construct* have only about sqrt(N) elements, not 1.41 * sqrt(N).

In 1938, James Singer found a beautiful construction using projective geometry. For every prime power q, he built a Sidon set with q+1 elements inside {0, 1, ..., q^2+q}. Since q^2+q ~ q^2, this gives roughly sqrt(N) elements. For concrete primes, Singer's sets are:

    q=2: {0, 1, 3}           -- 3 elements in {0,...,6}
    q=3: {0, 1, 3, 9}        -- 4 elements in {0,...,12}
    q=5: {0, 1, 3, 8, 12, 18} -- 6 elements in {0,...,30}

These are provably Sidon sets --- we verified all three computationally in Lean 4.

So there's a gap. The upper bound says at most ~1.41*sqrt(N). The lower bound says at least ~sqrt(N). The ratio is sqrt(2), about 1.41. For a problem in additive number theory, this is embarrassingly large. And it has been open for over 80 years.

Erdos offered **$1,000** for the answer to this question:

> *Is h(N) = sqrt(N) + o(sqrt(N))?*

Translation: as N grows, does the maximum Sidon set size approach sqrt(N), with an error term that becomes negligible? Nobody knows. The prize remains unclaimed.

## 4. Lindstrom's insight: exploiting structure

In 1969, Bernt Lindstrom found a way past the pigeonhole ceiling. Instead of just counting sums, he looked at the *internal geometry* of the set.

Sort your Sidon set: a_0 < a_1 < ... < a_{k-1}. Now look at consecutive differences: a_1 - a_0, a_2 - a_1, and so on. Then second-order differences: a_2 - a_0, a_3 - a_1, .... Then third-order, up to some order l.

The key insight: the Sidon property forces all these differences to be distinct positive integers. Think about why. If two pairs had the same difference, say a_i - a_j = a_m - a_n, then a_i + a_n = a_m + a_j --- a sum collision. Not allowed.

Now count. At order r, there are (k-r) differences. Summing over orders 1 through l gives m = l*k - l(l+1)/2 total differences. They're all distinct positive integers, so their sum is at least 1 + 2 + ... + m = m(m+1)/2. But the largest difference is at most N, and a telescoping argument bounds the total sum by l(l+1)N/2.

Setting these against each other:

    l * (2k - l - 1)^2  <=  4(l+1) * N

Now the magic: choose l ~ N^{1/4}. After algebra:

    k  <=  sqrt(N) + N^{1/4} + 1

This is strictly better than sqrt(2N). The leading coefficient went from 1.41 to 1.00, at the cost of a secondary term N^{1/4}. Since N^{1/4} grows much slower than sqrt(N), for large N this is a substantial improvement.

Lindstrom's bound introduced the **N^{1/4} error term** that has dominated the problem ever since. For 54 years, nobody could improve the coefficient on that term.

## 5. The 2023 breakthrough: complementary slack

In 2023, Balogh, Furedi, and Roy noticed something subtle. The two classical approaches --- the pigeonhole sum-counting and Lindstrom's residue-class trick --- have **complementary slack**.

Think of it like two rulers measuring the same stick. One ruler is accurate when the stick is short but imprecise when it's long. The other ruler is the reverse. By themselves, each gives you an approximate measurement. But if you use *both* simultaneously and take the tighter reading at each point, you get something better than either alone.

Technically, BFR combined Lindstrom's parametric bound (k^2 <= 2Nt + kt for a residue parameter t) with the Erdos-Turan sum count via a Cauchy-Schwarz variance decomposition. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality plays the role of forcing the two bounds to agree. When the sum distribution is uniform (Erdos-Turan is tight), the residue bound has slack. When the distribution is skewed, the residue bound tightens while Erdos-Turan loosens.

The result:

    k  <=  sqrt(N) + 0.998 * N^{1/4} + 1

The coefficient 0.998 looks negligible. But in a problem stuck at coefficient 1.000 since 1969, breaking below 1 was a genuine event in combinatorics.

## 6. Why verify this with a computer?

Mathematics is supposed to be certain. Proofs are supposed to be proofs. Why run them through a machine?

Because human proofs have errors. Not often, and rarely in the final statements --- but in the details, in the bookkeeping. In 2023, a significant result in graph theory was retracted because of an error in an inequality chain that dozens of experts had read and accepted. Formal verification catches these errors mechanically. Every step is checked against the axioms of mathematics by software that doesn't get tired, doesn't skip "obvious" steps, and doesn't defer to authority.

We used **Lean 4**, a programming language that doubles as a proof assistant. In Lean, you can't say "it's obvious that" or "by a routine calculation." You must provide explicit justification for every logical step. The compiler either accepts your proof or tells you exactly where the gap is.

The result: **1,857 lines of verified Lean 4 code across six files, with zero `sorry` stubs** (`sorry` is Lean's keyword for "trust me on this one"). Over 22 theorems are fully machine-checked. Every lemma is either proved to the kernel's satisfaction or honestly declared as an axiom.

## 7. Honest accounting: the axiom-based decomposition

Not every step could be machine-checked. Some mathematical arguments require infrastructure --- sorting algorithms over finite sets, real-number analysis, multi-page combinatorial constructions --- that doesn't yet exist in Lean's math library (Mathlib).

Rather than pretend these gaps don't exist, or hide them behind opaque tactics that *look* like proofs but silently assume the conclusion, we adopted an **axiom-based decomposition**:

- **Machine-checked:** all algebraic assembly. Inequality chains, cancellation, case splits, the logical plumbing that connects premises to conclusions. About 13 theorems fully proved.
- **Axiomatized:** 4 deep combinatorial results, each declared as an explicit `axiom` with a precise mathematical statement, a bibliographic reference, and a documented path to future closure.

The two outstanding axioms are:
1. The R-to-N conversion for Lindstrom's full bound (requires `Nat.sqrt` bounding)
2. The full BFR Sections 2-4 combination (~15 additional lemmas)

*(Note: We recently formally closed major gaps regarding elementary bounds and combinatorial difference counting—proving exactly that sorted enumeration yields distinct telescoping differences—reducing the axiom count down from four to two in the `Assembly_v2` module).*

A reader can see exactly where machine-checked reasoning stops and trusted mathematics begins. This is the opposite of a hidden gap. It's an invitation: here are the four things left to prove. Anyone with Lean expertise can pick one up and close it.

## 8. What's novel

To our knowledge, this is the **first formal verification of any Sidon set upper bound beyond the elementary k(k-1) <= 2N**.

That elementary bound has been the ceiling for proof assistants in this area. The Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture was formalized in Lean 4 by Tao and collaborators in 2024, and Bloom-Sisask's improvement of Roth's theorem has been partially formalized. But Sidon set bounds --- despite being central to additive combinatorics --- had no machine-checked proofs beyond the textbook counting argument.

Everything beyond that argument --- Lindstrom's order-of-differences, the residue-class parametric bound, the BFR variance decomposition --- required new formalization infrastructure. We built it, and the result covers the full trajectory from the 1941 Erdos-Turan bound through the 2023 state of the art.

The axiom-based approach itself is a contribution. It demonstrates that you can formally verify the logical skeleton of a deep result *now*, without waiting years for every supporting lemma to exist in Mathlib. The skeleton is where most errors hide anyway --- in the algebraic assembly that connects the big lemmas, not in the big lemmas themselves.

## 9. What's still open

The $1,000 question remains. The gap between sqrt(N) (Singer's lower bound, 1938) and sqrt(N) + 0.998*N^{1/4} (BFR's upper bound, 2023) is real. To close it, you would need either:

1. **A better construction** --- a Sidon set with more than sqrt(N) + c*N^{1/4} elements for some constant c > 0. This would disprove the Erdos conjecture.
2. **A fundamentally new upper bound technique** --- something that pushes the error below N^{1/4}. This would support the conjecture.

Neither path looks close. The N^{1/4} barrier has survived every attack since 1969. Recent work by Carter, Hunter, and O'Bryant (2025) shaved the coefficient to 0.98183, but the exponent 1/4 is untouched. Whether it can be replaced by 1/4 - epsilon for any epsilon > 0 is the essence of the prize problem.

But now the known results stand on machine-checked foundations. The next mathematician who wants to push past BFR can build on a verified base, knowing that the algebraic plumbing connecting Lindstrom's ideas to BFR's improvement has been checked by a machine with no ego and no blind spots.

## The Feynman test

Pick numbers that don't collide when you add them in pairs. How many can you pick from {0,...,N}? About sqrt(N). We know it's *at least* sqrt(N) because Singer built sets that big in 1938. We know it's *at most* sqrt(N) plus a small correction of size N^{1/4} because Lindstrom (1969) and Balogh-Furedi-Roy (2023) proved it. We checked their proofs with a computer and found zero errors. Whether the correction can be made even smaller --- that's worth a thousand dollars, and nobody knows.
