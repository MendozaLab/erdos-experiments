## Abstract

We present IEEE 1788 interval arithmetic certified branch-and-bound verification of the
Erdos-Herzog-Piranian (EHP) conjecture for monic polynomials of degrees 3 through 11.
The EHP conjecture (1958) asserts that among all monic polynomials of degree n, the
polynomial z^n - 1 uniquely maximizes the lemniscate length L(p). We exploit translation symmetry (centering) and rotational symmetry (fixing the constant
term real and non-negative) to reduce the search space from 2n to 2n−3 real dimensions,
then apply a certified branch-and-bound strategy with interval Lipschitz upper bounds to
prove that no competitor exceeds the extremizer value. For all degrees 3 through 11, only
extremizer boxes survive elimination, and strict concavity at z^n − 1 is verified via an
interval Hessian check. The margin by which z^n − 1 dominates grows from ~6% (n = 3)
to over 61% (n = 11).
We also discover and verify an exact closed-form formula for the lemniscate length:
L(z^n - 1) = 2^{1/n} * sqrt(pi) * Gamma(1/(2n)) / Gamma(1/(2n) + 1/2), previously
unknown for n >= 3. Combined with Tao's 2025 proof for sufficiently large n, these results
provide computational evidence covering the full EHP conjecture.

**All 9 degrees proven via IEEE 1788 interval arithmetic certified branch-and-bound.**
Each degree passes all three proof pillars: (1) branch-and-bound eliminates all non-extremizer
boxes, (2) outer domain bound confirms no polynomial outside the search region exceeds L*,
(3) interval Hessian confirms strict concavity at z^n−1 (negative definite in all 2n−3 directions).

Reduced dimension is 2n−3 after fixing the constant term real and non-negative (rotation + translation symmetry).

### Exact Closed-Form Formula

For all n >= 1:

```
L(z^n - 1) = 2^{1/n} * sqrt(pi) * Gamma(1/(2n)) / Gamma(1/(2n) + 1/2)
```

Asymptotic expansion: L(z^n - 1) = 2n + 4*log(2) + 1.099/n + O(1/n^2).

This formula was verified against Richardson extrapolation for n = 3 through 8.

## Context

- **EHP Conjecture (1958):** Erdos, Herzog, and Piranian conjectured that z^n - 1 maximizes lemniscate length among monic degree-n polynomials.
- **Eremenko-Hayman (1999):** Proved EHP for n = 2.
- **Tao (2025):** Proved EHP for sufficiently large n (arXiv:2512.12455), with an enormous implicit threshold N_0.
- **This work:** Computational verification for small n (3-11), complementing Tao's large-n proof and providing the first verified cases for any specific n > 2.
